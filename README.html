<h3>STANDARD THEME</h3>
<hr />

<p>Moodle's default theme is a very neutral grey/white theme.</p>

<p>This theme is always the most up-to date.</p>

<p>Programmers working on Moodle should always design for this 
theme, and add new styles to this theme.</p>

<p>Other themes should always reference the style sheet from 
this theme before defining their own styles to augment or
replace the standard styles.  In this way custom themes 
are not as affected by Moodle upgrades.</p>


<p>The standard stylesheet is:
<pre>
   $CFG->wwwroot/theme/standard/styles.php
</pre>
</p>
